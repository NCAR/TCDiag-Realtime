History
-------
The original tropical cyclone model diagnostics capability was originally developed for the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS), and later as a stand-alone package called ‘Model Diagnostics’, by the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA). As of the METplus v6.0.0 / MET v12.0.0 release in early 2024, METplus now integrates these capabilities into an extensible framework called the TC-Diag tool. The goal of this tool is to provide the full set of CIRA's Model Diagnostics package in an platform-independent and extensible framework for reproducible verification.

The METplus documentation provide information on how to use the individual METplus components that are related to the TC model diagnosties capabilities, including the TCDiag Tool, TC-Pairs, database applications, and plotting. The purpose of this documentation is to provide additional guidance on how to install and use the TCDiag Realtime system's elaborated use cases in real-time and retrospective settings.
